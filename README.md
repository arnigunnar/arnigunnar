## A Full Stack Yoda, Software Architect & Technical Consultant

Transforming business processes through technology is my passion, I love creating software solutions. Ever since my first websites over 25 years ago, to the more complicated product solutions I have had a hand in since, I have fallen in love with the production process.

Currently I am a freelance technical solutions provider, focusing on the travel sector.
