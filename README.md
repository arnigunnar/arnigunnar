## Founder @ [Itsy](https://www.itsy.so/)

**Travel planning made simple for small travel agencies.**

I'm building Itsy to make travel agency software a pleasure to use—empowering travel professionals to deliver excellent experiences for their clients without fighting their tools.

### Why I'm building Itsy

I've spent nearly 20 years solving problems in travel tech. In 2006, I founded **Odin Software** with the goal of building a modern software solution for travel agencies. Over 13 years, we grew it into the platform of choice for most of Iceland's leading travel agencies, building a profitable company with a team of around 10 people.

I left Odin in 2019, but the itch to build never went away. Itsy is everything I've learned about what travel agencies actually need—distilled into software that gets out of the way.

### Background

My journey in travel tech started in 2002, building booking platforms before founding Odin. Along the way, I've worked with companies like Icelandair, Blue Lagoon, Arctic Adventures, and dozens of travel agencies across Iceland. I've seen what works, what breaks, and what people actually use.

### Tech

.NET on Google Cloud, Next.js on Vercel, PostgreSQL. 25 years of full-stack experience across C#, TypeScript, React, and most major cloud platforms.
